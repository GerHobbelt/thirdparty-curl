# This test is quite timing dependent and tricky to set up. The time line of
# test operations looks like this:
#
# 1. curl sends a PUT request with Expect: 100-continue and waits only 1 msec
#    for a 100 response.
# 2. The HTTP server receives the PUT request, but starts sending its 417
#    response slowly, due to its writedelay setting.
# 3. curl doesn't receive the expected 100 response before its timeout expires,
#    so it starts sending the body. It is throttled by a --limit-rate, so it
#    sends the first 64 KiB then stops for 1000 msec due to this
#    throttling.
# 4. The server finally finishes sending its 417 response (after about
#    300 msec) while curl is throttled.
# 5. curl responds to this 417 response by closing the connection (because it
#    has a half-completed response outstanding) and starting a new one. This
#    new request does not have an Expect: header so it is sent without delay.
#    It's still throttled, however, so it takes about 9 seconds to finish
#    sending.
# 6. The server receives the response and this time acks it with 200.
# Because of the timing sensitivity, this test is marked flaky to avoid it
# being run in the CI builds.
#
# Increasing the --limit-rate would decrease the test time, but at the cost of
# becoming even more sensitive to delays (going from 500 msec to 250 msec or
# less of accepted delay before failure).  Adding a --speed-time would increase
# the 1 second delay between writes to longer, but it would also increase the
# total time needed by the test, which is already quite high.
#
# The assumption in step 3 is also broken on NetBSD 9.3, OpenBSD 7.3 and
# Solaris 10 as they only usually send about half the requested amount of data
# (see https://curl.se/mail/lib-2023-09/0021.html).
